[The snow glows white on the mountain tonightNot a footprint to be seenA kingdom of isolationAnd it looks like I'm the queenThe wind is howling like this swirling storm insideCouldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've triedDon't let them in, don't let them seeBe the good girl you always have to beConceal, don't feel, don't let them knowWell, now they knowLet it go, let it goCan't hold it back anymoreLet it go, let it goTurn away and slam the doorI don't care what they're going to sayLet the storm rage onThe cold never bothered me anywayIt's funny how some distance makes everything seem smallAnd the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at allIt's time to see what I can doTo test the limits and break throughNo right, no wrong, no rules for meI'm freeLet it go, let it goI am one with the wind and skyLet it go, let it goYou'll never see me cryHere I stand and here I stayLet the storm rage onMy power flurries through the air into the groundMy soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all aroundAnd one thought crystallizes like an icy blastI'm never going back, the past is in the pastLet it go, let it goWhen I'll rise like the break of dawnLet it go, let it goThat perfect girl is goneHere I stand in the light of dayLet the storm rage onThe cold never bothered me anyway] g
